      <abstract>This is a tile of the standard one-meter resolution digital elevation model (DEM) produced through the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) .  The elevations in this DEM represent the topographic bare-earth surface.  USGS standard one-meter DEMs are produced exclusively from high resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) source data of one-meter or higher resolution.  One-meter DEM surfaces are seamless within collection projects, but, not necessarily seamless across projects.  The spatial reference used for tiles of the one-meter DEM  within the conterminous United States (CONUS) is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) in units of meters, and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  All bare earth elevation values are in meters and are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).  Each tile is distributed in the UTM Zone in which it lies.  If a tile crosses two UTM zones, it is delivered in both zones.  The one-meter DEM is the highest resolution standard DEM offered in the 3DEP product suite.  Other 3DEP products are nationally seamless DEMs in resolutions of 1/3, 1, and 2 arc seconds.  These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation Dataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers under the 3DEP program and lost the NED branding.  Other 3DEP products include five-meter DEMs in Alaska as well as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity images. All 3DEP products are public domain.</abstract>
      <purpose>The 3DEP data serves as the elevation layer of The National Map, and provides basic elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. The data are utilized by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other applications.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This is a 10,000 meter by 10,000 meter tile. The geographic area of coverage is described below in the Bounding Coordinates. Additional information for the 3DEP may be found on http://nationalmap.gov/elevation.html. Data may be downloaded through The National Map Viewer: http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html. Direct links for direct access by automated services are provided in the Distribution section of this metadata.</supplinf>
